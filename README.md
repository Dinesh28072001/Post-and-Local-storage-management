# Post-and-Local-storage-management

Step 1: 

Create a new React project
Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to create the project. Then run the following command to create a new React project:

npx create-react-app local-storage-app


Step 2: 


Once the project is created, navigate to the project directory:

cd local-storage-app


Replace the code in src/App.js with the following:

import React from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Switch, Route, Link } from 'react-router-dom';
import Home from './Home';
import ViewAll from './ViewAll';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Router>
      <div>
        <nav>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <Link to="/">Home</Link>
            </li>
            <li>
              <Link to="/view-all">View All</Link>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </nav>

        <Switch>
          <Route path="/view-all">
            <ViewAll />
          </Route>
          <Route path="/">
            <Home />
          </Route>
        </Switch>
      </div>
    </Router>
  );
};

export default App;


Create two new files, src/Home.js and src/ViewAll.js, and copy the corresponding code provided earlier into these files.


Step 3:

Install additional dependencies
Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

npm install react-router-dom


Step 4: 

Start the development server
Finally, start the development server by running the command:

npm start

This will launch the React development server, and you should be able to access the application in your browser at http://localhost:3000.


You can now navigate between the Home and View All pages using the links provided in the application.
